I saw her dancing' there by the record machine
I knew she must've been about seventeen
The beat was going' strong
Playin' my favorite song

An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till she was with me, yeah me
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till she was with me, yeah me, singing'

I love rock n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock n' roll
So come an' take your time an' dance with me

She smiled so I got up and asked for her name
That don't matter, she said
'Cause it's all the same

I said 'Can I take you home where we can be alone?'

An' next we were moving' on
She was with me, yeah me
Next we were moving' on
She was with me, yeah me, singing'

I love rock n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock n' roll
So come an' take your time an' dance with me

I said, Can I take you home where we can be alone?

An' next we were moving on
Sh was with me, yeah me
An we'll be moving' on
An' singing' that same old song
Yeah with me, singing'

I love rock n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock n' roll
So come an' take your time an' dance with me
