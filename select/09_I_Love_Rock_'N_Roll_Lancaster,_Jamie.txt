I saw him standin' there by the record machine
I knew he must have been about seventeen
The beat was goin' strong
Playin' my favorite song

And I could tell it wouldn't be long
'Til he was with me, yeah, me
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
'Til he was with me, yeah, me, singin'

I love rock n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
Oh

He smiled, so I got up and asked for his name
"That don't matter", he said, "'cause it's all the same"
I said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"

And next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah, me
Next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah, me singin'

I love rock n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me

Said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"
Next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah, me
And next we were movin' on
And singin' that same old song
Yeah, with me, singin'

I love rock n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with
I love rock n' roll
So put a little dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock n' roll
So come a little time and dance with me
